This is a complete file for the project – Smart login System coded in Python and Flask.

It can do two things :

1. Registration of new user

2. Verification of old user


The username(or in this case user-face) will the of the user who wants to login, clicked by our own front camera. This recognition will be with the help of KNN algorithm which is a baseline algorithm but works considerably ok. You can also do it using the Siamese network in my repo. 

The password for the verification will be OTP of the user sent to the email id corresponding to the name of the identified person stored in our local database.

This password will be entered via gesture recognition using OpenCV module.
